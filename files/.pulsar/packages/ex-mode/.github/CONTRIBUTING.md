# Ex-Mode Contributing Guidelines

Current Maintainers:

- [@jazzpi](https://github.com/jazzpi)

This project is accepting new maintainers. Interested parties should open a new issue titled `New Maintainer Request`.

## Pull Requests

- If the PR *fixes* or should result in the closure of any issues, use the `fixes #` or `closes #` syntax to ensure issue will
close when your PR is merged
- All pull-requests that fix a bug or add a new feature *must* have accompanying tests before they will be merged. If you want
to speed up the merge of your PR, please contribute these tests
 - *note*: if you submit a PR but are unsure how to write tests, please begin your PR title with `[needs tests]`
- Please use the [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) as a guide for submitting your PR.

## Issues

- Be aware of the responsibilities of `ex-mode` vs `vim-mode`
- If you have identified a bug we would welcome any Pull Requests that either:
 - Fix the issue
 - Create failing tests to confirm the bug
