# 0.99.1:
- Fix: Attempt to user non-yet-supported register( such as `" 0 y` ) no longer throw exception.
  - This is regression introduced in v0.98.0. #844.
- Fix: Quickly switching active tab and back no longer re-start remaining flash animation #846.
  - In previous version of vmp, You can see remaining flash re-triggered by(just an example)
    1. `y i p` see yanked paragraph is flashed.
    2. `cmd-shfit-]`( `pane:show-next-item` ), `cmd-shfit-]`( `pane:show-previous-item` ) quickly.
    3. When you come back to original editor, once fadeout-ed flash is re-started. But no longer from this version.

# 0.99.0:
- Fix: Incorrect mouse selection when editor was soft-wrapped.
- Improve: Make conditional keymaps config's title and description more user friendly.
- New: Conditional keymap config `keymapYToYankToLastCharacterOfLine`(default `false`).
  - By default `Y` behaves as `y y`.
  - This is not consistent with `C` and `D` which behaves `c $` and `d $`.
  - By enabling this `Y` behaves as `y $`.
- New: Screen line based column motion commands `g 0`, `g ^` and `g $`.
  Commands:
    - `move-to-beginning-of-screen-line`( keymap `g 0` )
    - `move-to-first-character-of-screen-line`( keymap `g ^` )
    - `move-to-last-character-of-screen-line`( keymap `g $` )
  Config: `allowMoveToOffScreenColumnOnScreenLineMotion`( vim-mode-plus original, intentionally differentiate default behavior from pure-Vim ).
    - Affects how `g 0`, `g ^` and `g $` find destination position.
    - When a line is wider than the screen width(no-wrapped line a)
      - `true`(default): move to off-screen column.
      - `false`: move to on-screen(visible) column( = Vim default ).
    - Behavioral difference appears only when
      - Line is not wrapped.
      - Destination column is off-screen(invisible because of the line is wider than screen width).
        - for `g 0`: column-0 is off-screen
          - `true`: move to column-0.
          - `false`: move to first-visible-column.
        - for `g ^`: first-char-column is off-screen
          - `true`: move to first-char-column.
          - `false`: move to first-visible-char-column.
        - for `g $`: last-char-column is off-screen
          - `true`: move to last-char-column.
          - `false`: move to last-visible-char-column.

# 0.98.0:
- Improve: Now `r`, `f`, `F`, `t`, `T` and `surround` use mini-editor to read user-input. #838
  - Benefit?
    - Old: User cannot input non ascii char. It used keybinding to read user-input.
    - New: User can input non ascii char and also can paste from clipboard( `cmd-v` ).
  - Limitation
    - When user set keymap like `f a`, original `f` command no longer work properly( You cannot use `f b`, `f c`, etc... ).
    - This is Atom's keymap system's limitation which cannot follow activeElement change when replaying keystroke on partial-match.
  -  Still `m`, ``` ` ```, `'` read char through keybinding intentionally.
    - These command use ascii char only.
    - To allow user to set `m` prefix keymap like `m X` without breaking whole `m` feature.

# 0.97.2:
- Fix: Clicking find-and-replace's project-find result view throw exception when `projectSearchResultsPaneSplitDirection` set to `none`(default). #830.
  - Because, it opens matched entry on **same pane** and fire `mouseup` only(without preceeding `mousedown` event) on newly opened editor.
  - Now vmp guard wired mouse-event by explicitly manage next expecting mouse-event.

# 0.97.1:
- Fix: When `startInInsertMode` was `true` clicking editor in `insert-mode` throw exception but no longer. #830.

# 0.97.0:
- Maintenance: Rewrite big amount of part from CoffeScript to JavaScript.
  - Spec files are not re-written yet(and no plan at this point).
  - Now files under lib/ directory are 29(JavaScript) vs 9(CoffeScript).
  - Rewritten is done in following processare
    - 1. Translate by decaffeinate command provided by decaffeinate project(thanks!).
    - 2. Manual cleanup.
  - Sorry If I create some regression.
- Improve: Hide mode-string in status-bar while non-editor-item become active item(e.g. settings-view).
- Breaking: Rename and change behavior of `vim-mode-plus:clear-persistent-selection` to `vim-mode-plus:clear-persistent-selections`.
  - How?
    - Old: clear persistent selections for all editors in workspace.
    - New: clear persistent selections for current active editor.
  - Why I changed
    - Old behavior is inconsistent with other similar command.
    - I couldn't imagine practical scenario where old behavior shines.
- Improve: `maximize-pane` #828, #829
  - New: Config option `centerPaneOnMaximizePane` ( default `true` ). by @dcalhoun
    - Old behavior: Text in editor is always centered.
    - New behavior: Text in editor is centered if `centerPaneOnMaximizePane` is `true`.
  - New: Command `vim-mode-plus:maximize-pane-without-center`(default keymap: `ctrl-w Z`).
  - Confusing?
    - If you never need centering effect, set `centerPaneOnMaximizePane` to `false` and use `vim-mode-plus:maximize-pane` command.
    - If you sometime want to centering, but sometime don't want centering
      - Leave `centerPaneOnMaximizePane` to `true`( default )
      - Use `maximize-pane`(`cmd-enter` or `ctrl-w z`) and `maximize-pane-without-center`(`ctrl-w Z`) command respectively."
- Internal, Dev, Breaking: Remove introspection report generating command, which was important in early phase of vmp, but no longer.
- Dev: `write-command-table` no longer throw exception on first use after restart.
- Tweak: Change normal operator flash duration from 0.3s to 0.5s.
- Improve: Mouse #826
  - Fix: click in `visual.blockwise` mode no longer move cursor to first line of editor.
  - Now mouse action appropriately modify selection and enter `visual-mode` if necessary.
    - `shift-click`
    - `click`(mousedown -> mouseup)
    - `drag`(mousedown -> mousemove -> mouseup).
    - double click: Atom select clicked word, vmp update visual-mode.
    - triple click: Atom select clicked row, vmp update visual-mode.

# 0.96.2:
- Improve: #819 TextObject function for `language-rust` now also works on Windows platform.

- Fix: `g q q` now work again. `g w w` also work now.
# 0.96.1:
- Fix: `g q q` now work again. `g w w` also work now.

# 0.96.0:
- New, Breaking: Operator `reflow-with-stay`. #818
  - `reflow-with-stay` is `g q` equivalent feature. but unlike `g q`, `g w` keep cursor at same position.
  - It auto-format each lines to fit with `editor.preferredLineLength`.
  - Breaking: Existing command for `g q` was `auto-flow`, but renamed to `reflow` at this timing.
  - If you enabled, `stayOnTransformString` config, `g q` and `g w` behave exactly same way.
- Improve: #819 TextObject function now work for both `language-rust` and `atom-language-rust`.

# 0.95.0:
- New: Pane manipulation commands `ctrl-w H`, `ctrl-w J`, `ctrl-w K`, `ctrl-w L`.
  - These feature are merged from my `paner` package.
  - Following keymaps are provided in `atom-workspace` scope.
    - `ctrl-w ctrl-x` or `ctrl-w x`: `vim-mode-plus:exchange-pane`
    - `ctrl-w K`: `vim-mode-plus:move-pane-to-very-top`
    - `ctrl-w J`: `vim-mode-plus:move-pane-to-very-bottom`
    - `ctrl-w H`: `vim-mode-plus:move-pane-to-very-left`
    - `ctrl-w L`: `vim-mode-plus:move-pane-to-very-right`
- Fix: No longer throw exception when accessing unsupported register via `insert-mode`'s `ctrl-r`(`insert-mode`) #812.
- Support: set minimum engines to `1.18.0`.

# 0.94.0:
- Improve: Improve Fold handling in several operations. #809.
  - `y y`, `d d` now yank/delete whole fold.
  - `o` now start insertion from *next* line of end-of-fold(OLD-ver was next line of start-of-fold).
  - `V` on folded row select whole fold, so `V d` delete multiple lines which was folded.
    - No longer show cursor at incorrect row when `V` on folded row(long lived cosmetic issue now FIXED).
  - `p` on folded row paste *next* line of end-of-fold(OLD-ver was next line of start-of-fold).
- New: Add several Fold manipulation commands. #807
  - Commands:
    - `z c`: `fold-current-row`
    - `z C`: `fold-current-row-recursively`
    - `z o`: `unfold-current-row`
    - `z O`: `unfold-current-row-recursively`
    - `z a`: `toggle-fold`
    - `z A`: `toggle-fold-recursively`
  - Previously `z c`, `z o` was mapped to following Atom's native fold commands. But now replaced with `vmp`'s one.
  - Why? for consistency, and vmp's one is multi-cursor aware, linewise selection aware(not manipulate next line of selected row).
    - `z c`: `editor:fold-current-row`
    - `z o`: `editor:unfold-current-row`
- Improve, Experimental: Hide, left/right dock when `maximized-pane`.
- Improve: Disable `maximized-pane` keymap(`cmd-enter`) in `tree-view` scope.
- Keymap, Breaking: Remove default `ctrl-v` keymap in search-mini-editor to avoid conflicts. #791
  - Previous version have following keymap(was experimental, you can recover this by set manually).
    - scope: `atom-text-editor.vim-mode-plus-search`
    - keystroke: `ctrl-v` to `vim-mode-plus:search-activate-literal-mode`
- Fix: Protect from `p` throw exception in some uncertain situation `p` #802.
- Fix: [Atom-v1.19-beta] Smooth scroll now work again.
  - This issue is introduced by the big change in editor-rendering rewrite in v1.19.
- Fix: [Atom-v1.19-beta], `ctrl-y` on first line of editor incorrectly mutate that row(do nothing is correct behavior) #808
- Fix: [Atom-v1.19-beta] `ctrl-y`, `ctrl-e` now correctly use 2 lines offset.
- Keymap: Make numpad0-9 behave same way as normal 0-9 key #806
- Improve?, Breaking: Remove angle-bracket(<,>) matching for `%` motion. refs #700
  - Still work in progress to improve behavior.
- Spec: Fix spec failure in v1.19.0-beta.

# 0.93.0:
- New: `count` support for `g t` to activate Nth pane item(= tab).
  - `3 g t` activate 3rd pane item.
  - `7 g t` activate 7th pane item.
  - `g t` just activate next pane items as previous version.
  - When specified pane items was not exist, do nothing.
  - Limitation: vim-mode-plus's command only works on normal text-editor.
    - You can not do `g t` on non editor pane Item such as `setting-view`.
- Fix: #766 executing `maximize-pane` on single-pane workspace make screen blank.
  - This was happening only when pane have not yet split once after atom launch.
- Fix: #777 `J` at last buffer row no longer clear text.
- Doc: mention ex-mode link on README.md since it's now support vim-mode-plus.

# 0.92.1:
- Improve: #782 Skip creating marker/decoration for empty range in hlsearch and incsearch.
  - E.g.
    - When user searched `()` literally, it matches empty-range between each char.
    - In previous release, invisible hlsearch/incsearch marker/decoration was created.
    - By skipping this empty range highlight, improve responsiveness when user repeat `n` or `N` for that search.

# 0.92.0:
- Fix: blockwise-selection was not cleared correctly in some situation(but I noticed via code review)
- Fix: #780 No longer throw exception when close editor in the middle of smooth scrolling.
- New: #770, #774 Add fold manipulation commands based on PR by @weihanglo.
  - Commands: Put non-NEW commands here for thoroughness.
    - `z a`: `toggle-fold`, toggle( fold or unfold ) cursor's fold.( NEW )
    - `z r`: `unfold-next-indent-level`, unfold deepest folded fold. support count.( NEW )
    - `z m`: `fold-next-indent-level`, fold deepest unfolded fold. support count.( NEW )
    - `z M`: `fold-all`, unfold all fold.( not NEW )
    - `z R`: `unfold-all`, fold all fold.( not NEW )
  - Setting: `maxFoldableIndentLevel`( default `20` )
    - Folds which startRow exceeds this level are not folded on `zm` and `zM`
    - e.g.
      - If you have 3 folds in editor, each fold starts following indentLevel.
        - `fold-a: 0`
        - `fold-b: 1`
        - `fold-c: 2`
      - `maxFoldableIndentLevel = 20`:
        - `z M` fold all
        - `z m` fold `fold-c`, `fold-b`, `fold-a` on each time.
      - `maxFoldableIndentLevel = 1`:
        - `z M` fold `fold-a`
        - `z m` fold `fold-b`, `fold-a` on each time.
      - `maxFoldableIndentLevel = 0`:
        - `z M` fold `fold-a` only.
        - `z m` fold `fold-a`.
  - Implementation is NOT exactly same as pure-Vim.
    - Pure-vim: explicitly manage `foldlevel` value and `zm`, `zr` is done based on `foldlevel` kept.
    - vmp: Does not manage `foldlevel` explicitly, instead it detect fold state from editor.
      - This approach gives better compatibility for Atom's native fold commands like `cmd-k cmd-1`
- Improve: Don't auto-load `vimState.highlightSearch` when nothing to highlight.
- Internal: #768 Support upcoming new decoration `type: 'cursor'` for cursor visibility in visual-mode.
- Internal: #763 add spec for ensure minimum required file on vmp startup.

# 0.91.0:
- Improve, Performance: Reduce amount of IO( number of files to read ) on startup further. #760
  - Avoid require on initial package activation. Especially following widely-used libs is not longer `require`d on startup.
    - `lib/selection-wrapper.coffee`
    - `lib/utils.coffee`
    - `underscore-plus`
  - Now `swrap` and `utils` are accessible via lazy-prop( `vimState.utils` and `vimState.swrap` ).
- Developer: When `debug` setting was set to `true`, log lazy-require info when atom `inDevMode`.

# 0.90.2:
- Fix: For `search` on initial active-editor after startup, `highlightSearch` did not happened.
  - This is regression introduced as part of lazy instantiation of `HighlightSearchManager`.

# 0.90.1:
- Fix: Sorry, removed leftover `console.log` in atom running in dev mode.

# 0.90.0:
- Improve: Reduce activation time of vim-mode-plus to reduce your frustration on Atom startup. #758
  - About 2x faster activation time( Full detail is on #758 ).
  - With Two technique
    - Define all vmp-command from pre-populated command-table and lazy-require necessary command file on execution.
    - Defer instantiation of xxxManager referred by `vimState`.
      - E.g. `vimState.highlightSearch` is instance of `HighlightSearchManager` and it's now set on-demand.
  - [For vmp developer only] If command signature was changed, need update command-table.
    - Command signature it's name and scope(e.g. `vim-mode-plus:move-down` and `atom-text-editor` )
    - [Caution] `write-command-table-on-disk` command is available only when atom running in dev-mode.
    - [Caution] Directly update `lib/command-table.coffee` if populated-table was changed from loaded one.
- New, Breaking: Default keymap update #753
  - macOS user only
    - `ctrl-s` mapped to `transform-string-by-select-list` in `normal-mode` and `visual-mode`
  - All user
    - `z` in `operator-pending` is short hand of `a z`(`a-fold`).
      - You can do `y z` instead of `y a z`. E.g. When you yank foldable whole `if` block.
      - You can do `c z` instead of `c a z`. E.g. When you change foldable whole `if` block.
    - `g r` mapped to `reverse`
    - `g s` mapped to `sort`
    - `g c` mapped to `select-latest-change` which correspond to `g v` ( `select-previous-selection` )
    - `g C` mapped to `camel-case`
  - What was broken?
    Before: `g c` was for `camel-case`, `g C` was for `pascal-case`.
    Now: `g c` is for `select-latest-change`, `g C` is for `camel-case`. No default `pascal-case`.
- New: Target alias for surround #751, #755
  - Now `b`, `B`, `r`, `a` char is aliased to corresponding target.
    - `b` is alias for `(` or `)`
    - `B` is alias for `{` or `}`
    - `r` is alias for `[` or `]`
    - `a` is alias for `<` or `>`( I don't like this, just followed how `surround.vim` is doing ).
  - These alias can be used in `surround`, `delete-surround`, `change-surround`.
    - When have these keymap: `surround`( `y s` ), `delete-surround`( `d s` ), `change-surround`(`c s`)
      - `y s i w b` is equals to `y s i w (`.
      - `y s i w B` is equals to `y s i w {`
      - `y s i w r` is equals to `y s i w [`
      - `y s i w a` is equals to `y s i w <`
- New: InnerPair pre-targeted `rotate` command
  - Commands:
    - `rotate-arguments-of-inner-pair`
    - `rotate-arguments-backwards-of-inner-pair`
  - No keymap by default.
  - E.g.
    - When you map `g >` to `rotate-arguments-of-inner-pair` and `g <` to `backwards`
    - You can rotate arg of parenthesis by `g >` and `.` if necessary, `g <` for backwards.
- Internal: Cleanup `developer.coffee` and remove unused dev commands.

# 0.89.0:
- New: Text-object for arguments
  - Keymap:
    - `i ,`: `inner-arguments`
    - `a ,`: `a-arguments`
    - `,`: `inner-arguments`( shorthand keymap available only in operator-pending-mode )
  - Example:
    - `c i ,`( you can do `c ,`)
    - `d i ,`( you can do `d ,`)
    - `d a ,`
    - `v a ,`
  - From where this text-object find arguments?
    - Auto-detect inner range of `()`, `[]`, `{}` pairs and parse argument and select.
    - When it failed to find inner-pair range, it fallbacks to current-line range.
  - How to determine separator of arguments?
    - Heuristically determine separator from comma `, ` or white-space.
      - When some separator contains comma, it treat comma as separator.
      - When no separator contains comma, it treat white-space as separator.
- New, Setting: #747 Conditional keymap setting `keymapPToPutWithAutoIndent`.
  - When enabled, `p`, and `P` paste with-auto-indent for linewise paste.
  - Why I added this helper setting?
    - You can set keymap by yourself in your `keymap.cson`
      - But you need to be careful to not overwrite `p` in `operator-pending-mode`.
    - In `normal-mode`, `p` is mapped to `put`.
    - In `operator-pending-mode`, `p` is mapped to `inner-paragraph`, as shorthand of `i p`.
    - When set `p` keymap in your `keymap.cson` without breaking predefined shorthand `p`.
    - You need to exclude `operator-pending-mode` scope like this.
      ```coffescript
      'atom-text-editor.vim-mode-plus:not(.insert-mode):not(.operator-pending-mode)':
        'p': 'vim-mode-plus:put-after-with-auto-indent'
      ```
    - But I don't think I can expect normal user to do so. So
- New: `rotate`, `rotate-backwards` operator
  - No keymap by default.
  - ChangeOrder family operator, which rotate line in `linewise`, argument in `charactewise`.
- New: #748 ChangeOrder family( child ) operator now work differently for charactewise-target.
  - Affects: `reverse`, `rotate`, `rotate-backwards`, `sort`, `sort-case-insensitively`, `sort-by-number`
  - [Same]: When `linewise` target, it change order of line.
  - [New]: When `characterwise` target, it auto-detect arguments and change order of arguments within characterwise-range.
- New: Operator `split-arguments` and `split-arguments-with-remove-separator`
  - Commands:
    - `split-arguments`: split arguments into multiple-lines within specified target without removing separator.
    - `split-arguments-with-remove-separator`: behave same as `split-arguments` but it remove separator(sugh as `, `).
  - Keymap `g ,` to `split-arguments` by default( aggressive decision ).
    - Pure-Vim's `g , ` is "move to newer cursor position of change list", but vmp have no `changelist` anyway.
- New: [Experimental] Added `inner-pair` pre-targeted version of `split-arguments` and `reverse` to evaluate it's usefulness.
  - No keymap
  - Commands:
    - `split-arguments-of-inner-any-pair`
    - `reverse-inner-any-pair`
- Breaking: Remove `showCursorInVisualMode` setting
  - Notify and ask confirmation for auto-remove from `config.cson` if it set to non-default value.
- Improve: `r enter` to replace with new-line now correctly auto-indent inserted new-line.
- Improve: When `surround` linewse-target, now auto-indent surrounded lines more accurately than previous release.

# 0.88.0:
- Doc: New wiki page
  - DifferencesFromPureVim
  - VmpUniqueKeymaps
- Keymaps: Normal keymap addition
  - New: Now `subword` text-object have default keymap, you can change subword by `c i d`.
    - `i d`: `inner-subword`
    - `a d`: `a-subword`
  - `cmd-a` is mapped to `inner-entire` in `operator-pending` and `visual-mode` for macOS user.
    - So macOS user can use `cmd-a` as shorthand of `i e`(`inner-entire`).
    - E.g. Change all occurrence in text by `c o cmd-a` instead of `c o i e`
- Keymaps: Shorthand keymaps in `operator-pending` mode
  - Prerequisite
    - In `operator-pending-mode`, next command must be `text-object` or `motion`
    - So all `operator` command in `operator-pending-mode` is INVALID.
    - This mean, we can safely use operator command's keymap in `operator-pending-mode` as shorthand keymap of `text-object` or `motion`.
    - But using these keymap for `motion` is meaningless since motion is single-key, but text-object key is two keystroke(e.g. `i w`).
    - So I pre-defined short-hand keymap for text-object which was work for me.
  - What was defined?
    - `c` as shorthand of `inner-smart-word`, but `c c` is not affected.
      - You can `yank word` by `y c` instead of `y i w`. ( change by `c c` if you enabled it in setting )
      - To make `c c` works for `change inner-smart-word`, set `keymapCCToChangeInnerSmartWord` to `true`( `false` by default )
      - `smart-word` is similar to `word` but it's include `-` char.
    - `C` as shorthand of `inner-whole-word`
      - You can `yank whole-word` by `y C` instead of `y i W`. ( change by `c C` )
    - `d` as shorthand of `inner-subword`, but `d d` is not affected.
      - You can `yank subword` by `y d` instead of `y i d`. ( change by `c d` )
    - `p` as shorthand of `inner-paragraph`
      - You can `yank paragraph` by `y p` instead of `y i p`. ( change by `c p` )
- Keymaps: Conditional keymap enabled by setting.
  - Prerequisite
    - Added several configuration option which is 1-to-1 mapped to keymap.
    - When set to `true`, corresponding keymap is defined.
    - This is just as helper to define complex keymap via checkbox.
    - For me, I enabled all of these setting and I want strongly recommend you to evaluate these setting at least once.
    - These keymaps are picked from my local keymap which was realy work well for a log time.
  - Here is new setting, all `false` by default. Effect(good and bad) of these keymap is explained in vmp's setting-view.
    - `keymapUnderscoreToReplaceWithRegister`
    - `keymapCCToChangeInnerSmartWord`
    - `keymapSemicolonToInnerAnyPairInOperatorPendingMode`
    - `keymapSemicolonToInnerAnyPairInVisualMode`
    - `keymapBackslashToInnerCommentOrParagraphWhenToggleLineCommentsIsPending`
- Breaking: Default setting change:
  - `clearPersistentSelectionOnResetNormalMode`: `true`( `false` in previous version )
  - `clearHighlightSearchOnResetNormalMode`: `true`( `false` in previous version )
  - `highlightSearch`: `true`( `false` in previous version )
  - `useClipboardAsDefaultRegister`: `true`( `false` in previous version )
- New: #743, #739 New config option `dontUpdateRegisterOnChangeOrSubstitute`( default `false` ).
  - When set to `true`, all `c`, `s`, `C`, `S` operation no longer update register content.
  - If you want keep register content unchanged by `c i w`, set this to `false`.
- New: TextObject `comment-or-paragraph` for use of easy comment-in/out when `g /` is pending.
- Fix: For commands `set-register-name-to-*` or `set-register-name-to-_`, now show hover and correctly set `with-register` CSS scope on editorElement.
- Fix, Improve: #744 Make vmp work well with other atom-pkg or atom's native feature.
  - Update selection prop on command dispatch of outer-vmp command
    - Now correctly update cursor visibility and start `visual-mode` after `cmd-e` then `cmd-g`.
  - Update selection prop if editor retake `focus`.
    - Now correctly start `visual-mode` after `cmd-f` result was confirmed by `enter`.
- Improve: Better integration with `demo-mode` package
  - Postpone destroying operator-flash while demo-mode's hover indicator is displayed.
- Improve: When undo/redoing occurrence operation, flash was suppressed when all occurrence start and end with same column, but now flashed.
- Improve: Improve containment check for `togggle-preset-occurrence`
  - When cursor is at right column of non-word char(e.g. closing parenthesis `)`), not longer misunderstand that cursor is on occurrence-marker.
- Internal: #742 Rewrite `RegisterManager`, reduced complex logic which make me really confuse.

# 0.87.0:
- New: #732 Add integration with `demo-mode` package.
  - `demo-mode` is new Atom package I've released recently, it was originally developed as part of vim-mode-plus.
  - When demo-mode is activated via `demo-mode:toggle`, vmp do special integration to
    - Make operator flash duration longer than normal duration
    - Demo-mode hover indicator show `keystorke`, `command` and `kind`(extra info added by vmp) on each keybinding dispatch.
      - kind is one of `operator`, `text-object`, `motion`, `misc-command`
- New: #722 New version of put command which paste content to suggested indent level with keeping pasting text layout.
  - PR by @apazzolini
  - Normal `p`, `P` paste content as-is, so ignores desirable( or suggested ) indent level.
  - Following two command respect suggested indent level on linewise paste( no diff for characterwise paste ).
    - `vim-mode-plus:put-before-with-auto-indent`: Same as `put-before`(`P`) with respect suggested indent level.
    - `vim-mode-plus:put-after-with-auto-indent`:  Same as `put-after`(`p`) with respect suggested indent level.
  - No keymaps provided by default
- Improve: `o`, `O` to adjust IndentLevel when `o`, `O` is executed from empty row #723
  - PR by @apazzolini
  - To provider further pure-Vim compatible behavior.

# 0.86.3
- Improve: #727 Tweak incremental-search match highlight style to not hide covering text in some syntax-theme.

# 0.86.2
- Fix: #725 Now `v`( or `V` or `ctrl-v`) then `escape g v` correctly re-select previously selected range.
- Improve: #726 Relax selection-property assertion.
  - Fix: #716 No longer throw error when confirming color via color-picker then `escape`.

# 0.86.0, 0.86.1(just changelog-typo-fix):
- New: `insert-at-start-of-subword-occurrence` and `insert-at-end-of-subword-occurrence` command.
  - Start insert at start or end of `subword` occurrence.
  - E.g
    - When I map `{`, and `}` to these command in `normal-mode`.
      - `{ f`: start insert at each start of subword-occurrence within function.
      - `} f`: start insert at each end of subword-occurrence within function.
      - `{ p`: start insert at each start of subword-occurrence within paragraph.
- Internal, Breaking: Remove `did-restore-cursor-positions` hook which was used in Operator code but no longer used.
- Internal, Breaking: Remove many of simple accessor method like `getName`, `getOperator`, now just use `@name`, `@operator` to access these values.
- Improve: Hide cursor on early select
   - For `supportEarlySelect = true` operator( `surround`, `replace` ).
   - These operator began to shows cursor on early-select from Atom v1.15, but now hide again for early-select timing.
- Internal, Dev: #719 No longer use `HTMLElement` as search-input for speedy dev by hot-reload vmp.
- Internal, Breaking: Move `InsertMode`(was in `insert-mode.coffee`) operations under `MiscCommands`( in `misc-commands.coffee`)
- Improve: Keep original multi-cursor on occurrence operation by migrating mutation info.
- Improve: Simplify mark manager and destroy all marker on `vimState.onDidDestroy`.
- Improve: Clean up mutationManager.
- Fix, Internal: Now do TYPE check for spec-helper's `ensure` function's argument, some test was silently skipped in previous release.

# 0.85.1:
- Fix, SUPER Critical: #175 Moving cursor in `visual-mode` make Atom editor really slow.
  - vmp's mark is stored as marker and was created limitlessly without destroying previous-marker.
  - As number of marker increased, editor get really slow.
  - This is old Bug from original vim-mode, but impact get really significant from v0.58.0.
    - Since from v0.58.0, to track previousSelection(used for `g v`) `<` and `>` mark is updated on every `visual-mode` movement.

# 0.85.0:
- Fix: When `stayOnYank` was enabled, `y 0`, `y h` no longer move cursor.
- Fix: [Cosmetic but important] Fix very small cursor position jump( cosmetic ) when activating vL ( because of gap between px and em? )
- Fix: Respect `v` operator-modifier for `t`( Till ) motion.
  - e.g. In text "ab" when cursor is at "a"
    - Old: `d t b` delete "a"( Good ), `d v t b` delete "a"( Bad ).
    - New: `d t b` delete "a"( Good ), `d v t b` don't delete "a"( Good ).
- Improve: Now can select line ending new line char in `visual-mode`.
  - E.g. Move right by `l` at end of line select new-line.
- Fix: #699 Lost goalColumn in `visual.blockwise` when move across blank-row.
  - This is regression in v0.84.0.
- Fix: #119 When `j`, `k` is used as operator's target, don't apply operation when failed to move.
  - Now more compatible with pure Vim.
  - Example:
    - `d j` from last line do nothing. ( In previous version, delete last line ).
    - `d k` from first line do nothing. ( In previous version, delete first line ).
- Improve: `g v` after `vL`( visual-linewise ) to restore characterwise `column`.
- Fix: `v i p d` then `.` repeat from different cursor position now works correctly
- Internal:
  - Overhaul: `CursorStyleManager`, `SelectionWrapper`, `TextObject`, `BlockwiseSelection`
  - Rename `characterwiseHead` to `propertyHead` in `spec-helper.coffee`
  - Remove lots of unnecessary `null` guard.
- Breaking: Remove `All` text-obect, it's alias of `Entire` but not used.
- Breaking: Remove `Edge` text-object, it's experimentally added in the past, but not maintained and not as useful as I originally thought.
- Improve: TextObject
  - Improve: No longer iterate `selectTextObject` over each memberSelection of blockwise selection( blockwiseSelection consists of multiple selection ).
  - Improve: `Fold` , `Function` text-object now always expand if possible by checking containment against selected buffer range
  - Improve: `Pair` text-object now always find from cursor position.
  - Improve: Executing text-object from `vL` mode now works as expected in most of text-object.
  - Internal: Set wise explicitly in most of text-obect rather than dynamically determine from selection range.
  - Internal: Auto generate `Inner`, or `A` prefixed classes and `AllowForwarding` suffixed classes( reduced lots of boilerplate code ).
- Improve: visual-blockwise ( `vB`-mode )
  - #699 Fix: Now respect goalColumn in `vB` when move across blank row by `j` or `k`.
    - Regression introduced in v0.84.0.
  - #704 Rewrite vB-mode related code.
    - vB selection is normalized before selecting text-object.
    - So no longer iterate `selectTextObject` over each memberSelection of blockwise selection.
  - Improve: #438 when vB selection respect `goalColumn`
    - Original goalColumn is respected as long as selection-head is right-most column.

# 0.84.1:
- Fix: To fix vim-mode-plus-move-selected-text degradation.

# 0.84.0:
- Fix, Improve: #689 Occurrence was not worked for the word which include non-word char such as `$` and `@`.
  - E.g. `$var` in Perl, PHP.
  - This was because when finding occurrences, it searched by `\bword\b` pattern.
  - But `\b\$var\b` never match `$var`, in this case find by `\$var\b` pattern from this release( auto relax `\b` boundary ).
- Improve: Preserve fold on `g v`
- Internal:
  - Cleanup selection-wrapper code.
  - Remove unused functions from `utils.coffee`

# 0.83.0:
- Support: set minimum engines to `^1.14.0`
- Fix: When `o` was executed in `vL` mode, didn't correctly restore column on shift to `vC` or `normal`.
  - Now correctly restore `characterwise` column after `o` in `linewise` mode.
- Improve: `g .` correctly restore subword-occurrence-marker
  - `g .`( `vim-mode-plus:add-preset-occurrence-from-last-occurrence-pattern` ) is command to restore last cleared preset-occurrence.
  - It is useful when you mistakenly cleared it by `escape` and quickly recover last preset-occurrence marker.
  - Previously `preset-subword-occurrence` was not correctly restored by `g .`, but now fixed.
- Improve: Use faster `displayMarkerLayer::clear()` for hlsearch, occurrence-manager, search-model etc.
- Internal: add `dev` prefix for setting for dev-use.
- Internal: Remove lots of unused function in `utils.coffee`.
- Internal: add `vimState::getConfig` to access package settings.

# 0.82.3:
- Fix: `move-to-previous-subword` stops boundary of white-space unnecessarily( upstream issue auto-fixed)
  - Spec to accommodating wrong behavior removed.
- Fix: `B` moves to beginning of file when invoked from begging of line.
  - Introduced by upstream change in Atom v1.14.0( or v1.14.1?).

# 0.82.2:
- Fix: No longer throw exception when `showHoverSearchCounter` is enabled and editor was closed immediately after hover counter was shown.

# 0.82.1:
- Fix: `p`, `P` in vB-mode no longer throw exception #672
  - This bug was introduced in v0.80.0.

# 0.82.0:
- New: command `move-up-wrap`, `move-down-wrap`, `j`, `k` with line wrap( top-to-bottom/bottom-to-top ).
  - No keymap by default. intended to use from atom-narrow package(now I'm actively developping).

# 0.81.0:
- Improve, Breaking: Remove `fallbackTabAndShiftTabInNormalMode`
  - This was necessary since `tab`, `shift-tab` was mapped to `move-to-next-occurrence` and `move-to-previous-occurrence`.
  - When `true`, fallback `tab`, `shift-tab` to `editor:indent` or `editor:outdent-selected-rows` when no `occurrence-marker` exist.
  - But now, these mapping is defined in `has-occurrence` scope, which means `occurrence-marker` exists on editor.
  - So your `tab`, `shift-tab` is no longer conflict if no `occurrence-marker` exits.

# 0.80.0:
- Breaking: Disable `I`, `A` special keymap in `has-occurrence` scope.
  - To avoid surprising user. Now behave as normal `I` amnd `A`.
  - To insert start/end of each occurrences, use `visual-mode` select then `I` or `A`.
  - Or set keymap in your `keymap.cson` to restore previous verison's keymap.
    ```
    'atom-text-editor.vim-mode-plus.has-occurrence:not(.insert-mode)':
      'I': 'vim-mode-plus:insert-at-start-of-target'
      'A': 'vim-mode-plus:insert-at-end-of-target'
    ```

- Fix: No longer throw exception when specified register has no value(=text) on `p`, `P` operation. #656.
- Fix: Now `selection` properties cleared on each normal-mode operation finish to avoid hover counter is shown at incorrect position.
- Developer: Spec helper `ensureMode` no longer mutate passed array itself.
- Developer: `reload-packages` command now reload depending packages in correct order.

# 0.79.1:
- Fix: #653 Immediately close search-mini-editor when main editorElement was clicked to avoid stale decorations remains on editor.

  - Internal: Use new `PairFinder` class to find pair range(extracted from `text-object.coffee`).
  - Improve: Bracket TextObject: `(, )`, `{, }`, `[, ]`, `<, >`
    - Find range by considering syntax-scope. #644.
  - Improve: Quote TextObject: `'`, `"` etc..
    - Simply find quote if cursor is NOT in quote char #173, #638
    - If cursor is ON quote char consider inside/outside of double-quote #556, #642
- Improve: Fold text-object(`i z`, `a z`) no longer ignore fold on cursor's row. #636
- Internal: New `Base::scanForward`, `Base::scanBackward` and use it
- Internal: Lots of internal code cleanup(`utils.coffee`, `text-object.coffee` etc.)

# 0.77.0

  - Motion: `move-to-next-subword`, `move-to-previous-subword`, `move-to-end-of-subword`'
  - TextObject: `a-subword`, `inner-subword`(no keymaps by default)
  - OperatorModifier: `O` works as like `o`, except `O` works for subword.(e.g. `c O p`)
  - `g O`(`toggle-preset-subword-occurrence`) mark subword, subword-version of `g o`.
- New: TransformString family operator `split-string-with-keeping-splitter`, `sort-by-number`( no keymap )
- New `g q`(`auto-flow`) operator, `g q q` or `g q g q` works for current line #187
  - Implementation-wise, it just dispatch to core autoflow package. So might not be compatible with pure-Vim.
- Improve: `maximize-pane` #633
  - Tweak: Now set `left-margin`(`20%`) when maximized, so that code comes front of your eye.
  - Now hide statusbar.

- Internal: Rewrite `ctrl-a`, `ctrl-x`,  `g ctrl-a`, `g ctrl-x`
  - Breaking: No longer beep when failed.

# 0.76.0
- Breaking, Cosmetic: Remove `showHoverOnOperate` feature #626
  - Reason:
    - This is fancy feature added at very early phase of vim-mode-plus as experiment.
    - But this feature getting in a way to improve, cleanup vim-mode-plus.
